# ColorActivity

## Functionality
This app consists of a spinner and an adapter used to populate and create functionality for the app. 

When you launch the app, you are presented with a default color backdrop and a spinner (dropdown) menu.

This spinner has several colors, and each color's view in the dropdown is appropriately colored.

When you click on a color, the layout background changes to that color.

Press the back button and you will be returned to the main activity. You will see that the background color stays persistent and that the selected color in the dropdown is now white.
